 <p> I am Danielle Engelbrecht, a highly motivated student with a strong IT background and a diverse set of skills.I am actively pursuing opportunities to expand my expertise within the tech industry, particularly aiming to transition into a role as a full-stack software developer. I am currently engaged in a learnership program with Absa to further develop my skills in this area.</p>
<p1> As a young adult, I possess a keen willingness to continuously learn and adapt, evident in my pursuit of education across multiple fields. This approach has enabled me to acquire a breadth of skills and knowledge. Being open-minded, particularly as a young woman, is a valuable quality, particularly within the economic landscape of South Africa, where job opportunities may be limited despite possessing qualifications.</p1>
